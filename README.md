# SocialOS Framework

SocialOS is an open framework for building, deploying, and orchestrating AI-powered social media agents. This ecosystem enables developers to create agents that can engage with social platforms (with a focus on X/Twitter) in a way that's intelligent, contextual, and value-aligned.

## üåê Overview

SocialOS consists of several interconnected components:

- **Core Infrastructure**: Agent orchestration, memory systems, and runtime execution
- **Pre-built Agents**: Ready-to-deploy agents with specific functions
- **Developer SDK**: Tools to build and extend your own agents
- **Agent Marketplace**: Exchange, rent, and monetize agents
- **Governance Protocol**: DAO-style governance with $SOOS token integration
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Standard for on-chain agent interactions

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/socialos-org/socialos.git
cd socialos

# Set up development environment
npm install

# Run a sample agent
npm run demo:agent
```
